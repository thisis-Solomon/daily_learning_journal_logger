# Challenge Day 6: Daily Learning Logger

Build a Python script that allows you to maintain a daily
learning jouranl. Each entry will be saved into a `.txt` file
along with a timestamp.

The program should:
1. Ask the user what they learned today.
2. Add the entry to a file called `learning_journal.txt`.
3. Each entry should include the date and time it was written.
4. The journal should **append** new entries rather than oversrite.

Bonus:
- Add an optional rating (1-5) for how productive the day was.
- Show a confrimation message after saving the entry

Example:

2025-06-14 - 10:45 AM
